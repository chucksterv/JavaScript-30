# JavaScript30 - Course by Wes Bos

- This is my implementation of the JS30 Challenge by Wes Bos. Majority of it follows his solutions closely and I've marked the things that can be added in as features which I aim to develop.
- The code is heavily commented as I left explanations for myself regarding certain workings of JS.
- Current challenge - 04
